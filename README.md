# discord-rpc-bridge

A bridge to update Discord status when using Flatpak applications.

I recently switched over to Linux and noticed that Flatpak Steam and Flatpak Discord have trouble communicating due to the Flatpak app sandboxing. 
I also tried to symlink the Discord socket and tweak Flatpak permissions, but gave up.

So this is a tiny bridge to make it so Steam games show up in your Discord status as it would on Windows.
